#LockScreen / ScreenLock

LockScreen/ScreenLock is a home-screen button widget that locks the screen. It does not modify the lock-screen design/layout in any way as may other other apps with similar names. An app simple enough to be a demo, but may have a specific niche use case. The lock is instantaenous and one does not have to configure or wait for a timeout for the lock and pin screen.  

The lock screen / key-guard is a screen that prevents unintended access or taps when not in use, whicle simultaneously functioning as a security feature. A swipe-gesture or enterring the configured pin is often used to allow access. 

After installtion, the app will request/prompt for device-admin privilidges (different from being rooted) as the ability to lock the phone and bring up the keyguard is considered outside mainstay of regular apps. 

To uninstall one has to first remove the app's device-adminstrator privilidges. Privilege can be relinquished in the android-settings->security panel. Only then will android 4.4 allow uninstallation of the app.
