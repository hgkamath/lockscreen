LockScreen/ScreenLock is a widget app which allows you to make a home-screen button widget that when pressed locks the screen. It does not modify the lock-screen deisgn/layout in any way as may other other apps with similar names. It requires device-admin privilidges which is different from root proivilidges as the ability to lock the phone and bring up the keyguard is considered outside mainstay of regular apps. To uninstall one has to check that dev-admin privilidges have been relinquished in the settings->security panel. Only then will android 4.4 allow uninstallation.
