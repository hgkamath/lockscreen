#LockScreen / ScreenLock
Install app from Google [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ganasoft.lockscreenWidget)

LockScreen/ScreenLock is a home-screen button widget that locks the screen. An app simple enough to be a demo, but may have a specific niche use case. The lock is instantaneous and one does not have to configure or wait for a time out for the lock and pin screen.

The lock screen / key-guard is a screen that prevents unintended access or taps when not in use, while simultaneously functioning as a security feature. A swipe-gesture or entering the configured pin is often used to allow access.

After installation, the app will request/prompt for device-admin privileges (which is different from being rooted) as the ability to lock the phone and bring up the keyguard is considered outside mainstay of regular apps.

To un-install one has to first remove the app's device-administrator privileges. Privilege can be relinquished in the android-settings->security panel. Only then will android 4.4 allow un-installation of the app.

Non-Tampering: The app does not modify the lock-screen design/layout in any way as may other apps with similar names.
Permissions: The app does not require any (other than device-admin)
Privacy : The app does not collect, monitor, or use personal information. source code is available on-line to verify
