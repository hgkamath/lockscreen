#LockScreen / ScreenLock

LockScreen/ScreenLock is a home-screen button widget that locks the screen. It does not modify the lock-screen design/layout in any way as may other other apps with similar names. An app simple enough to be a demo, but may have a specific niche use case. The lock is instantaenous and one does not have to configure or wait for a timeout to for the lock and pin screen.  

It requires and will prompt for device-admin privilidges (different from being rooted) as the ability to lock the phone and bring up the keyguard is considered outside mainstay of regular apps. 

To uninstall one has to check that dev-admin privilidges have been relinquished in the settings->security panel. Only then will android 4.4 allow uninstallation.
